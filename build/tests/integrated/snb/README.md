SNB heat conduction tests
=========================

Runs the SNB heat conduction calculation on an imposed density and temperature
profile on an open field-line. Checks that heat fluxes at the boundary match

To make plots of the Spitzer-Harm and SNB heat fluxes, set `plot = True` in
the `runtest` python script.

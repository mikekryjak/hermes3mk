Transport of D,T, He and Ne with neutral recycling
==============================================

Simulates
- electrons
- ion species D+, T+, He+, Ne+
- neutral species D, T, He, Ne

Includes cross-field diffusion, parallel flow and heat conduction,
collisions between species, sheath boundary conditions and recycling.

Atomic reactions just include ionisation (and He+ -> He, Ne+ -> Ne recombination)
Neon reactions need the ADAS json_database.

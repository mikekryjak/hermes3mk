Transport of D,T and He with neutral recycling
==============================================

Simulates
- electrons
- ion species D+, T+, He+
- neutral species D, T, He

Includes cross-field diffusion, parallel flow and heat conduction,
collisions between species, sheath boundary conditions and recycling.

Atomic reactions just include ionisation (and He+ -> He recombination)

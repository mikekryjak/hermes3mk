1D flow with sheath boundary
============================

Evolves two species, electrons and ions, with separate pressures
(temperatures) but the same flow (zero current). The 1D system
has a no-flow boundary on the lower Y boundary, and a sheath on
the upper Y boundary.

The simulation is driven by a uniform source of heat and particles,
as sources in the Ni, Pe and Pi equations.

This simulation doesn't include heat conduction.
